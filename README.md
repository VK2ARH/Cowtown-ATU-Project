Documentation for the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club QRP ATU Project
This repository holds the files used in the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club (Fort Worth Tx) buildathon - QRP ATU.
The project built the 'Chinese ATU' which is generally a much maligned kit (with good reason), however if the errors with the kit are corrected, the kit forms the basis of a practical QRP Antenna Tuning Unit which performs well. The project leveraged from the corrections published by Carol which she outlined in her video https://youtu.be/JceLhTV28oI?si=o7JiJ1ZdggYO7Gk3. Thank you Carol for sharing this with the Amateur Radio Community.
The changes made for the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club project include:
-  The addition of a By-Pass switch
-  A new drilling template to overcome component conflict with each other and the case
-  A new panel overlay which provides for two sizes of capacitor knobs and a scale to record and read capacitor settings
-  A full colour and detailed step by step construction manual
-  Replacement of the magentic wire with a more workable 22awg wire - makes winding the inductor with all the taps much easier
This repository will be updated from time to time with documents as they are developed or become available.

No doubt there will be lots of suggestions, additions or modifications to progressively improve the build and the performance of the ATU. 

The initial documents posted to this repository will include:
-  Panel Overlay
-  Drill Template
-  PDF File outlining the project which was used by the Cowtown Amateur Radio Club - which includes some good pictures of the ATU
-  Detailed construction manual (v1.3)
